#team 4 Design-Discussion

Section A
Individual project
1.Xi Huang
	My project designs for a tourism company. It helps tourism company to collect all information from customers. Then office workers can manager their trips based on their information and requirements. And all customers and workers can set reminder to remind them when is the trip.

2.Longcheng Cai
	User call the app with functions, and app will save the data into the database. And app it self could be sorting with the list of the reminders.

3.Rigsang Doma
Pros: well encapsulation (Delete, Read, Update and Create)
ïƒ˜    Cleared and detailed on the reminders class. 
Cons: Our database has too many connections and less classes have access to Database.

4.Sean Ramlall
	This project designs a program that would be able to set and modify reminders. Using lists the users would add delete or modify the reminders. Users would be able to make multiple lists and they would have to choose a reminder by type. The reminder types would come from a server and the user would be able to specify the types.
Pros: this would do well to organize the lists and contain the reminders efficiently.
Cons: the server that would control the reminder types could cause problems if not done correctly

5.Joesph Dadic
	Joseph Dadic's design is a design for a general application to allow users to set Reminders within a preset list of existing reminders given within the application and the ability to add, delete, or edit the current reminders. The Pro's for this design and project is that is a general app for Reminders, which leaves a lot of room for customization. The con for this design is the way it is shown in the UML file. There are a few instances of repetition or redundancy and the interaction between the user and the database is too personal.

Section B
Team Design
	After we discussed, we decided to use Sean Ramlall's design as our group project. Based on his original project, we have a dicussion about his pros, cons and improvement. Our group project is a program that would be able to set and modify reminder. And it can also complete some functions based on customers' requirements. For example, customers can set, add, delete, check or edit his reminder to help them manager their time.
	Based on the project, we think we can add some functions. 
	The first one is repeat function. Once the reminder works, customers can make choices if they want to make the  reminder continue to work in some days or delete it.
	Second, customers can check their reminder based on name, reminder_id, days and place. Because some customers are too busy to remember their reminder_id, time, event and place. So, they can find it by name.
	Third, we are going to design a edit() function for customers. Let them edit the information or change the event or time instead of creating a new reminder. That's more effective.

Section C
Summary
	After this group cooperation, we have a deeper understanding with each other. Everyone is actively involved to make the group project better. It helps us learn a lot about teamwork. And we have a preliminary understanding of the design. That's a good experience. We look forward to the next group assignment.
